# BugTesterForVRChat

A prefab that will automatically test if U# functions work the way they should.
The prefab can be added to your world as a simple dashboard. Unexpected results will be highlighted with a special color.

The prefab is currently mostly focused on currently reported bugs. The covered bugs are listed here:

This prefab was created as the Edutainment prefab jam. Therefore, a critter will spawn for each bug that was found.

Note: A test image will automatically load to check if the image loader is working correctly.

## How to use:
- Add the repository or the project file found in releases to your project.
- Add the prefab found in BugTesterForVRChat/Prefabs/Main/BugTester.prefab to your scene.
